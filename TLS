There are two types of Encryptions
    1. Assymetric Encryptions
    2. Symmetric Encryptions

Assymetric Encryptions
    In Assymetric Encryptions, Two keys are used. Public key and Private Key.
    Server generates private and public keys and shares Public key with Client(Browser).

    CLient uses Public Key to enctrypt Content and sends across the network,. Server decreypts this content using its private key.

Symmetric Encryptions
    In Symmetric Encryptions, Only one key is used.
    Client and server used single key o enctrypt and dectrypt data.


TLS/SSL
Generic Flow

SKEY => Session Key
PUBKEY => Public Key
PRIKEY => Privite Key

    Client              ----          `  Server creates Public(PUBKEY) and Privite(PRIKEY) keys                                ----             Server
    Client              <---             Server  shares PUBKEY with Client                                                     <---             Server

    Client              ----             Server Uses  PRIKRY to decrypt the SKEY which is sent by Client                       --->             Server
    Client              ----             Server and Client communicates with shared SKEY untill it wont expire                 ----             Server
    Client              --->             Client send data by encryptiong it with SKEY                                          --->             Server
    Client              ----             Server Decrypts data by using SKEY                                                    ----             Server
    Client              <---             Server Sends data by encrypting using SKEY                                            <---             Server
